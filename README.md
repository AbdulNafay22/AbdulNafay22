# Hey, I’m Abdul Nafay 👋

I’m a 2nd year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University who enjoys building things, breaking them, debugging them, and building them again (hopefully better).

I like working on practical projects that actually solve problems and help me understand how things work under the hood.
