# Hey, I’m Abdul Nafay 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University who enjoys building things, breaking them, debugging them, and building them again (hopefully better).

I like working on practical projects that actually solve problems and help me understand how systems work under the hood — not just how to make things look good.
