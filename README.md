# Hey, I’m Abdul Nafay 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University who enjoys building systems, breaking them, debugging them, and rebuilding them better.

I focus on **practical, hands-on projects** that help me understand how software works under the hood — from backend APIs to full-stack applications — not just how to make things look good.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 InsightForge
An AI-powered study assistant that runs entirely **locally**, transforming raw academic text into structured learning material.

**What it does:**
- Generates concise summaries from study text
- Extracts key points automatically
- Estimates topic difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Creates revision questions for exam preparation
- Runs locally using Ollama — no cloud APIs, no data leakage

**Under the hood:**
- FastAPI backend with structured JSON responses
- Local LLM integration via Ollama (LLaMA 3.2)
- React + Vite frontend for real-time interaction
- Robust prompt design and response validation

**Tech used:** Python, FastAPI, Ollama, React, Vite

### 🔹 Apply Flow
A modern job application tracking web app designed to help students manage internship and co-op applications efficiently.

**What it does:**
- Track applications by stage (Saved, Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected)
- Search and filter your application pipeline
- Add, edit, and delete applications using a clean modal interface
- Responsive, dark-themed UI built for daily use

**Under the hood:**
- State-driven UI architecture
- Structured component design
- Built to integrate with backend services

**Tech used:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

### 🔹 AutoLog
A Python-based log analysis tool that scans system logs to detect suspicious activity and generate structured security reports.

**What it does:**
- Parses authentication and system logs
- Detects repeated failed login attempts within configurable time windows
- Flags potentially suspicious IP addresses
- Exports results as JSON or CSV reports

**Under the hood:**
- Modular parsing and analysis pipeline
- Time-window correlation logic
- CLI-based workflow designed for extensibility

**Tech used:** Python, CLI tooling, file I/O
